## Instructions for use

1. Go to the link [Unique char](https://daniilpopov0809.github.io/tech-task-PortaOne/)
2. Enter the text
3. Press `Confirm enter'
4. In the field `Result' - the received result
5. ``Clear area'' button to clear the input field and the result
6. ``Info'' button - information about the program

## Technical task:

It is necessary to develop a program algorithm that should perform the following:
- the program accepts an arbitrary text as input and finds in each word of this text the very first symbol that is NOT repeated in the analyzed word
- further, from the received set of symbols, the program must select the first unique one (that is, the one that is no longer found in the set) and return it.

For example, if the program receives the text below:

The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth
to the assembler.
The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand
languages.
Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language
expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within
the Tao.
But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.
         -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"

then it should return the character "m".

You are almost not limited in the choice of method and way of solving the problem. You may use any means and approaches as long as you comply with the two restrictions below. You can write the program in any programming language or use already existing programs and utilities.

There are 2 limitations to consider when performing:

### Limitation #1:
Anyone should be able to use your method. That is, if you used your own program to solve the problem, then another person should be able to compile or run it. If you used third-party programs, the other person should also be able to use them.

### Limitation #2:
when solving the problem, you cannot use illegal software (proprietary software that has been hacked, pirated copies, etc.). Also, if you took an idea, software or source code from a friend/colleague/on the Internet, you must indicate the source.

### Additional condition:
- also indicate the questions (if they arise) that you would like to ask before starting to solve the problem.
